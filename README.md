# DodgeTheClouds
DodgeTheClouds is an iOS application that incorporates custom Bezier Paths, Core Graphics animations, 
and gesture recognizers to allow the user to maneuver an airplane to avoid oncoming clouds.

This project started as a platform to learn about Bezier Paths and animations and turned into a fun game.

Custom Bezier Paths were used to create cloud obstacles as well as the airplane that the user controls.
The clouds animate across the screen using core animation.
The user dodges the clouds with gesture recognizers.
